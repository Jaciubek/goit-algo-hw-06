Homework description

Task 1

Create a graph using the networkX library to model a real-world network (e.g., a city's transportation network, a social network, or an Internet topology).

 ðŸ“– The real network can be chosen at your discretion if you cannot come up with your network close to reality.


Visualize the created graph, and analyze the main characteristics (for example, the number of vertices and edges, the degree of vertices).



Task 2

Write a program that uses the DFS and BFS algorithms to find paths in the graph that you developed in the first task.

Then compare the results of both algorithms for this graph, highlighting the difference in the paths obtained. Please explain why the paths for the algorithms are the way they are.



Task 3

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in the developed graph: add weights to the edges and find the shortest path between all graph vertices.
